# 141. Linked List Cycle

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integet `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. if `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

## Follow up:
Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e constant) memory?
